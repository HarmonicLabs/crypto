collection of cryptographic functions that support every js runtime for ES5+

## Disclaimer

The purpose of the library is to guarantee support for any javascript runtime with ES5+.

**THIS IMPLEMENTATION SHOULD NOT BE ASSUMED TO BE SAFE**

If you are in a node js environment you should use the [node crypto native module](https://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html); without doubt more preformant and secure.
